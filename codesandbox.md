# 🧩 React API Data Listing

This project is a simple React application that fetches and displays data from an external API using **Axios**, `useEffect`, and `useState`. It's a great example of how to work with asynchronous data in React using functional components and hooks.

> ✅ Built and tested on **CodeSandbox**

## 📦 Features

- 🔄 Fetches data from an API on component mount
- 🧠 Uses React Hooks for state management and side effects
- 📃 Displays data in a clean and readable format
- ❗ Handles loading and error states gracefully

---

## 🧠 How It Works

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  axios.get("https://example-api.com/data")
    .then(response => setData(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching data:", error));
}, []);
useEffect: Runs the API call once when the component mounts

axios: Performs the GET request

useState: Stores and updates the response data
